# Pocket-Algorithm
Implementing Pocket Algorithm Using Jupyter Notebook



-implement the Pocket algorithm again using your own generated data. Yourdata doesn't need to be linearly separable, it can actually be any type of data.
-Implemented this method using numpy constructs and used the visualization techniques. 
-I have used Half Moon data set from the ML-SciKit book.
